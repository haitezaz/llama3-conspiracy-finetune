# ðŸ§  LLaMA 3.1â€“8B Fine-Tuned on Conspiracy QA â€” Using Unsloth + LoRA

This project fine-tunes Metaâ€™s **LLaMA 3.1â€“8B Instruct** model on a **custom-built dataset** of over 430 conspiracy-themed question-answer pairs using [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) and **LoRA** for efficient training on a single GPU.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The model was trained to generate answers on a wide range of conspiracy topics such as:

- Government secrecy  
- Alien coverups  
- Mind control programs  
- Historical manipulation  
- Secret organizations like Illuminati, Freemasons, etc.

The goal was to simulate a highly specific style of conversational generation that reflects internet conspiracy discussions â€” useful for both satire and serious exploration of belief modeling in LLMs.

- ðŸ›  **Data generation code not included**: It was iteratively modified and improved over time, making it unfit for static upload. However, the structure is easily reproducible from the JSON format.
